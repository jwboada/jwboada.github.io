<p><br></p>
<p>the following sections include the instructions for producing the recipes included in this book. each section also lists any special equipment needed and any additional ingredients other than herbs required for the method. these instructions are the only place where precise measurements will be used. instead, recipes are given in parts/ratios of herbs, and the instructions on this page illustrate how to utilize a given formula of herbs; see <a href="#formulation">formulation</a> for a more detailed explanation of this recipe design philosophy and examples of how to convert formulas into measurements. in the case of a handful of more complex recipes, multiple sets of these instructions will be used to produce both the building blocks of the recipe and the final product. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="infusion-working-with-water"><strong>infusion: working with water</strong></h2>
<p>infusing herbs in water is one of the most common approaches to working with herbs. it has many advantages: water is usually easy to find and work with; water infusions are quick to produce; one can consume larger quantities of water-based preparations, lending themselves more easily to casual herbal beverages. use spring water or filtered/distilled water over tap water whenever possible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="measurements"><em>measurements</em></h3>
<p>when preparing herbs casually, we often use teaspoons and tablespoons to measure. however, herbs vary wildly when it comes to fitting them in measuring spoons; flat dried leaves like those of peppermint are much easier to handle than fluffy dried leaves like those of artichoke or big dried flower buds like those of calendula. referring to measuring herbs in this way is an invitation to trial and error rather than to accurate replication of a standard volume. </p>
<p>for all medicinal purposes or whenever trying to strictly follow a formula, herbs should be measured using a scale. mass measurements are frequently given in grams (g) for smaller preparations; for larger preparations measurements are also given by weight in ounces (oz). </p>
<p>water is always measured by volume, frequently in fluid ounces (fl oz) but also in mililiters (mL), especially for smaller quanitities. note also that water may easily be measured in grams since at room temperature, 1 mL of water has a mass of 1 g. </p>
<p>the herb-to-water ratio depends on use and taste. for medicinal purposes, make a standard infusion, typically defined as 1 oz (approx. 29 g) of dried herb for every 32 oz (approx. 1 L) of water, i.e., about a 1:32 ratio. this generally produces a very strong infusion, likely a stronger flavor than one would want for casual drinking. consider this an upper limit for an herb-to-water ratio for drinking purposes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="tisanes-hot-water-infusions"><em>tisanes (hot water infusions)</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: pot/kettle, measuring spoons or kitchen scale, strainer</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: spring/filtered/distilled water</p>
<p>heat water to boiling, then let cool a few minutes. pour over dried leaves and let steep at least 10 minutes, then strain and drink. for stronger infusions, steep longer, up to letting the herbs and water cool completely to room temperature.</p>
<p>for dried herbs, consider using 1-1.5 tsp (maybe around 1-2 g) of herb per 8 oz of water as a starting place. for fresh herbs, use a higher herb-to-water ratio, closer to 1 oz of fresh herb per 8 oz of water. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="macerates-cold-water-infusions"><em>macerates (cold water infusions)</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: jar with a lid, measuring spoons or kitchen scale, strainer</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: spring/filtered/distilled water</p>
<p>pour room temperature water over herbs in a jar with a lid. ensure the herbs are properly hydrated: stir the herbs and/or cap the jar and shake. steep covered on the counter anywhere from 2-12 hours, then strain and drink. overnight is a great option; consider the phase and sign of the moon to infuse herbs under her light.</p>
<p>for dried herbs, consider using 1-1.5 tbsp (maybe around 3-6 g) of herb per 16 oz of water as a starting place. for fresh herbs, use a higher herb-to-water ratio, closer to 1 oz of fresh herb per 8 oz of water. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="decoctions"><em>decoctions</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: pot, kitchen scale, strainer</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: spring/filtered/distilled water</p>
<p>pour room temperature water over dried herbs in a pot with a lid. with the lid on, bring to a light boil and simmer for at least 20 minutes, then remove from the heat, strain, and drink. for a stronger infusion, either simmer for a longer time; or simmer uncovered and reduce the decoction to anywhere from ¾ to ¼ of the original volume; or, after turning off the heat, let the herbs cool together with the water for an hour or longer before straining and drinking.</p>
<p>decoctions are frequently made with dried herbs, usually tough plant material like roots and seeds that require a stronger method of extraction. consider using 2-5 g of dried herb per 8 oz of water as a starting point. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="extended-water-technique"><strong>extended water technique</strong></h2>
<p>the following sections give options for utilizing herbal water infusions made by one or more of the above methods for working with water.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="bath-soaks"><em>bath soaks</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: muslin bag (optional)</p>
<p>use an herbal infusion as a bath soak. consider making the infusion stronger than you would than if you were going to drink it as it will be diluted in the bath; perhaps use a standard infusion ratio of 1 oz herb to 4 cups water and/or let the herbs infuse for a longer period. add the herbal infusion directly to bath water. alternatively, place about 1 oz of herbs in a muslin bag and let the herbs infuse in the hot bath water; this will result in a weaker infusion. epsom salts are a welcome addition to any herbal bath.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="syrups"><em>syrups</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: jar with an airtight lid (or other airtight storage)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: simple syrup or honey</p>
<p>add simple syrup or honey to an herbal infusion to create an herbal syrup. this adds sweetness, which can help improve the flavor of herbal preparations, especially when bitter or pungent herbs are used. honey is naturally soothing, making it particularly useful for making syrups for coughs or sore throats. adding a sugar element also adds a preservative quality; herbal syrups should last in the fridge at least several months to a year. </p>
<p>consider using about 25-50% of the herbal infusion volume for the sweetener. adding a splash of infused vinegar or a tincture or glycerite of one of the herbs used (or other complementary herbs) can also help strengthen the medicinal qualities and add a bit more preservative quality.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="maceration-working-with-vinegar-glycerin-alcohol-oil"><strong>maceration: working with vinegar, glycerin, alcohol, oil</strong></h2>
<p>the term maceration in herbalism refers to letting herbs sit in a liquid menstruum (solvent) to break down the plant material and extract its constituents, properties, and energy into the liquid. when using water, the time of maceration is fairly short, at most a manner of hours; it cannot be much longer as mold and bacteria from the air will naturally begin to grow in the mixture of water and plant material. the preservative qualities of vinegar, glycerin, alcohol, and oil allow for longer maceration times, which can lead to stronger/more concentrated medicine and magic. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="shape-of-the-process"><em>shape of the process</em></h3>
<p>start by preparing the herbs: either blend dried herbs to a coarse or fine powder in a coffee grinder or chop fresh herbs to a coarse to fine dice. cover the prepared herbs with the menstruum in an airtight jar for at least 2 weeks, shaking the jar every day. strain using a muslin bag – for larger quantities, use a tincture/fruit press. consider filtering the resulting liquid before bottling the completed product. </p>
<p>ideally there should be enough solution in the jar for a layer of solution at least ⅛ to ¼ inch thick to form (either below or above the herb) as it settles; some herbs take up more space and such a layer may or may not form, but feel free to add additional menstruum if needed or desired.</p>
<p>2 weeks is generally considered sufficient for extraction, but feel free to incorporate any astrological considerations when deciding how long to macerate. using the moon cycle is common: from new moon to full moon (about 2 weeks) or from new moon to new moon (about 4 weeks). with oil and alcohol, it is generally fairly safe to macerate for longer periods (up to several months), but shaking the jar every day is important to ensure proper exposure of the herb to the solvent and to prevent surface growth.</p>
<p>tailoring this shape to a specific recipe mainly involves determining how to prepare the menstruum and how much menstruum to use for the amount of herb; the subsequent sections describe how to do this for vinegar, glycerin, alcohol, and oil. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="vinegars"><em>vinegars</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: knife and cutting board (for any fresh herbs), jar with an airtight lid (plastic if possible; if not, a metal lid and plastic wrap), strainer, cheescloth, pour-over filter setup with coffee filter (optional)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: apple cider vinegar (or any other vinegar)</p>
<p>working with vinegar is usually not an overly precise process: fill a jar with an airtight lid about ⅔ to ¾ full of herbs, packing the herbs down slightly, then fill the jar with vinegar. apple cider vinegar is frequently used, but any vinegar can be used.</p>
<p>the acidity of vinegar can tarnish/corrode metal, so use a plastic lid if available or place 1-2 layers of plastic wrap atop the jar before screwing the lid on. fresh or dried herbs can be used, but be aware that the water content of fresh herbs may lead to mold forming in the vinegar either during maceration or after straining. to help prevent mold, monitor the vinegar closely, shake daily (or multiple times a day), and filter after straining out the plant material – also, resist the temptation to squeeze out infused vinegar from fresh plant material when straining.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="glycerites"><em>glycerites</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: coffee grinder, kitchen scale, graduated cylinder (for precise volume measurements, optional), jar with an airtight lid, strainer, cheesecloth, tincture/fruit press (optional)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: pure vegetable glycerin, spring/filtered/distilled water</p>
<p>the method of making a glycerite by macerating herbs in glycerin solution is only appropriate for dried herbs. all such glycerites can be made with 60-80% glycerin solution (if unsure, use 70%), but the herb-to-glycerin-solution ratio for the herb used will be found in the recipe. to produce the glycerin solution, dilute pure glycerin with water to the desired percentage. </p>
<p>the herb-to-glycerin-solution ratio used is typically between 1:6 to 1:10 for many common herbs, where the herb measurement is given by mass (or weight) and the glycerin solution measurement is given by volume. units used are grams (g) of herb to milliliters (mL) of solution or ounces (oz) of herb to fluid ounces (fl oz) of solution. processing the dried herbs in a coffee grinder will most likely be necessary to attain full coverage of the herbs by the menstruum for these ratios.</p>
<p>for example, making a 1:8 glycerite of 25 g of herb would call for 200 mL of solution; a 70% glycerin solution would then use 140 mL of pure glycerin and 60 mL of water. for 5 oz of the same herb, use 40 fl oz of solution, consisting of 28 fl oz of glycerin and 12 oz of water for 70%.</p>
<p>when straining glycerites, make sure to squeeze out as much menstruum from the herb as possible; use a tincture/fruit press if making larger quanities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="tinctures"><em>tinctures</em></h3>
<p>there are two main methods for tincturing by maceration in alcohol solution: a folk method that does not use precise measurements similar to the process for making vinegars and a method that uses measurements in the same mass/weight-to-volume process as with glycerites. each of these methods can be used with either fresh or dried herbs. </p>
<h5 id="folk-method"><em>folk method</em></h5>
<p>equipment needed: jar with an airtight lid, strainer, cheesecloth, tincture/fruit press (optional), pour-over filter setup with coffee filter (optional)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: any 80- or 100-proof spirit</p>
<p>for the folk method, fill a jar with an airtight lid about ⅔ to ¾ full of herbs, packing the herbs down slightly (pack a little tighter for fresh herbs), then fill the jar with alcohol. use a 40-50% alcohol solution – vodka is frequently used for a more neutral flavor, but use any 80- or 100-proof spirit that would match the flavor/energy of the herbs. when straining, squeeze out as much menstruum from the herb as possible.</p>
<h5 id="massweight-to-volume-method"><em>mass/weight-to-volume method</em></h5>
<p>equipment needed: coffee grinder (for dried herbs) or knife and cutting board (for fresh herbs), kitchen scale, graduated cylinder (for precise volume measurements, optional), jar with an airtight lid, strainer, cheesecloth, tincture/fruit press (optional), pour-over filter setup with coffee filter (optional)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: 190-proof alcohol, spring/filtered/distilled water</p>
<p>for the mass/weight-to-volume method, consult the recipe for both the percentage/concentration of the alcohol solution and for the herb-to-alcohol-solution ratio for the particular herb used. a ratio of 1:5 is very common for most dried herbs, and almost all fresh plant tinctures use a 1:2 ratio. units used are grams (g) of herb to milliliters (mL) of solution or ounces (oz) of herb to fluid ounces (fl oz) of solution. processing dried herbs in a coffee grinder or finely chopping fresh herbs will most likely be necessary to attain full coverage of the herbs by the menstruum for these ratios. to produce the alcohol solution, dilute 190-proof alcohol to the appropriate percentage. 190-proof alcohol (95% alcohol solution) is often treated like 100% alcohol to make calculations easier. </p>
<p>for example, if an herb requires a 1:5 ratio of herb to 70% alcohol, then to tincture 20 g of the herb, use 100 mL of solution, which would be 70 mL of 190-proof alcohol and 30 mL of water. working out the math to account for 190-proof alcohol being only 95% alcohol would yield about 74 mL of 190-proof alcohol and 26 mL water. for smaller quantities this discrepancy is negligible; for larger quantities, it may be worthwhile to determine the exact measurements.</p>
<p>when straining tinctures, make sure to squeeze out as much menstruum from the herb as possible; use a tincture/fruit press if making larger quanities.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="oils"><em>oils</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: kitchen scale (optional), jar with an airtight lid, strainer, cheesecloth, pour-over filter setup with coffee filter (optional)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: any food- and/or cosmetic-grade oil</p>
<p>infused oils can be made like a folk method tincture: fill a jar with an airtight lid at least ¾ full with herbs, then cover with oil. for the measurement-inclined, a typical ratio for macerating dried herbs in oil is 1:8, e.g., 1 oz of dried herb per 8 oz of oil. any kind of oil can be used, but it should be ethically, sustainably, and organically produced if possible. when straining, squeeze out as much oil from the herb as possible. filtering the oil is recommended if the oil is intended to go on the skin.</p>
<p>most dried herbs can be macerated in oil. some plants may also be infused fresh, but when in doubt, use dried to reduce the chance of the oil becoming contaminated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="extended-oil-technique"><strong>extended oil technique</strong></h2>
<p>the following sections describe an alternative method for making infused oils as well as two ways of converting infused oils into skin care products.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="michael-moore-blender-method-for-oil-infusion"><em>michael moore blender method for oil infusion</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: coffee grinder, kitchen scale, jar with an airtight lid, blender, strainer, cheesecloth, pour-over filter setup with coffee filter</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: 190-proof alcohol, any food- and/or cosmetic-grade oil</p>
<p>this alternative method for using oil utilizes alcohol as an intermediary solvent and a blender to facilitate infusion. this method is only for dried herbs, but has the advantage of only taking a little over a 24 hour period to produce an herbal oil.</p>
<p>start by blending the herbs into a fine powder in a coffee grinder. place the powdered herb in a jar with an airtight lid and add about 0.5 oz (roughly 15 g) of 190-proof alcohol per 1 oz of herb; stir to wet the herb and achieve a consistency similar to moist soil or wet sand. cover and let sit for about 24 hours. place the powdered, wet herbs into a blender and cover with about 8 fl oz of oil per 1 oz of herb. blend on high for 5 minutes; the blender jar should get quite warm. let cool with the blender lid off, then strain using a muslin bag or cheesecloth. filtering the oil is optional but highly recommended; be aware that it may take several hours to filter.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="salves"><em>salves</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: double boiler or a pot and heat-proof bowl, jars</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: beeswax</p>
<p>turn an infused oil into a salve by adding about 1 tbsp of beeswax for each 1 fl oz of oil. stir them together over a double boiler until the beeswax melts completely, then pour into small containers and allow to solidify into a salve. let the salve cool completely to room temperature before capping the containers to avoid condensation forming. note that the oil/beeswax mixture will start to solidify quickly upon making contact with cool surfaces.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="whipped-body-creams"><em>whipped body creams</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: double boiler or a pot and heat-proof bowl, refrigerator, immersion blender or hand mixer, jars</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: cocoa butter, shea butter</p>
<p>turn an infused oil into a whipped body cream by adding about ¾ cup each of cocoa butter and shea butter for each 5 fl oz of oil. stir them together over a double boiler until the cocoa butter and shea butter melt completely, then let cool – first on the counter until the bowl cools down, then in the fridge. the idea is to use a blending device to whip the cool but not completely solid oil mixture until it attains a soft, spreadable consistency. an immersion blender works welll (use the blender attachment, not the whisk attachment), a hand mixer may also do. achieving a solid but spreadable texture may require repeatedly whipping for about 1 minute and cooling the mixture in the fridge for 20-30 minutes. this is transmutation: observe closely, be patient, visualize the end result, let your instinct guide you. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="fermentation-working-with-life"><strong>fermentation: working with life</strong></h2>
<p>fermentation is an often overlooked way of working with herbs; or rather, fermentation is usually seen as a subfield of culinary technique and separate from the common herbal preparation techniques. fermentation has much to offer – there are many <a href="https://isappscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Marco-health-benefits-fermented-foods-ISAPP-rev-171.pdf">recorded health benefits</a>, but just as valuable are the lessons fermentation has to offer in terms of interacting with the world around and within us, which is at every moment teeming with microscopic (and often reviled) life. fermentation shows us that the line between death and life is not so well defined; that decomposition is as important a stage of life as what comes before. furthermore, fermentation teaches patience and how to work with time in new ways, as fermenting often requires long, nebulously-defined time frames; it teaches us to observe, to taste, to actively experience in order to figure out what stage a recipe is at, rather than to just adhere to a predetermined amount of time.</p>
<p>one method for converting an herbal <a href="#infusion-working-with-water">infusion</a> into a fermented herbal beverage is presented below.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="ginger-bug-starter"><em>ginger bug starter</em></h3>
<p>equipment needed: grater, kitchen scale, jars, cloth or paper towel, rubber band, funnel and fermentation-grade flip-top bottles (optional)</p>
<p>additional ingredients needed: organic ginger root, white sugar or honey, spring/filtered/distilled water, lemons</p>
<p>creating a ginger bug is simple, relatively quick, and can be achieved spontaneously, i.e., without a preexisting starter. in a jar, combine about 10 g of freshly grated organic ginger (organic is important here as non-organically grown ginger is often subjected to treatments that reduce its viability as a starter) with 30 g white sugar or honey and 1 cup water. cover it with a cloth or paper towel secured with a rubber band to allow airflow but prevent bugs from entering. store it in a warm place (72-85º F) and stir it a few times every day; after 2-5 days it should start to bubble/froth, indicating that it is infused with life. from here, feed it with another 10 g of grated organic ginger and 30 g sugar/honey; continue to feed it this way every 1-2 days or so until you are ready to use.</p>
<p>to create an fermented herbal beverage, combine the strained active ginger bug with 14-15 cups of room temperature herbal infusion (looking for about a gallon/4 L total volume here) and 395 g sugar/honey in a jar (honey tends to lend a sweeter/stronger flavor so consider using less, closer to 300 g), and the juice of about 2 lemons to help balance the flavor and lend some preservative quality while it ferments. for best results, use a jar that is much larger than the amount of liquid to have a large surface area and allow for easy vigorous stirring. cover again with a cloth or paper towel and let sit in a warm place, stirring multiple times a day, until it begins to froth just like the ginger bug did. this might take another 1-3 days, and feel free to add a little more grated ginger to the beverage if it is not activating. the fermented beverage can be enjoyed at this stage, where it will be sweeter and less carbonated. the beverage can also be bottled (using fermentation-grade flip-top bottles that can withstand pressure) and left to ferment for an additional 1-2 days, which should produce a drier and more carbonated beverage.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="formulation"><strong>formulation</strong></h2>
<p>the recipes in this book are given in formulas of parts/proportions rather than in exact measurements. one reason is that this frees the recipes from being tethered to a specific amount of end product, and in particular it frees individual herbs in a formulation from specific measurements. </p>
<p>this is particularly liberating for less precise preparations like tisanes, macerates, decoctions, vinegars, and folk method tinctures that may not be intended to have rigid measurements and ratios of herbs to menstruum; and as mentioned earlier, measuring herbs is not always a straightforward or accurately repeatable process. so instead of writing a tisane recipe that calls for 1 tsp of chamomile and 1 tsp of rose for 12 oz of water, the recipe is abstracted to equal parts chamomile and rose and a reader may, according to their taste and practice, decide what those measurements should be for the amount of tisane they would like to make. alternatively, a large quantity of the dried herbs can be mixed together in ratio (e.g., 1 oz of chamomile and 1 oz of rose) and the instructions for making a tisane above can be used for the mixture of herbs.</p>
<p>another advantage of formulation by parts is that allows for easy blending of simples, or single herb preparations. this particularly applies for techniques that are more precise, like the mass/weight-to-volume methods for making glycerites and tinctures. for instance, when using multiple herbs in a tincture, herbs may differ in the preferred concentration of alcohol to use or the preferred herb-to-alcohol-solution ratio. in this case, simple tinctures of each of the individual herbs can be made and those simples can then be blended by parts to produce the formulation. </p>
<p>formulation by parts also allows for the freedom and creativity of abstraction to support working with herbs. a recipe given in parts need not even be tethered to the given method of preparation; if a particular ratio of herbs works well as a tisane, it may also work well as a  glycerite or tincture, opening up new ways to work with the energy of the original recipe. at any rate, each reader necessarily will produce their own recipes, by their own hands, with their own process, even if following a set of instructions. ultimately, this book intends to be a vehicle for learning rather than a source of knowledge; a medium by which a reader can develop their own schemata, connections, associations, techniques, skills, and understanding; more akin to a musical score, which does nothing on its own but provides context with which an individual can create, recreate, interpret, reinterpret, and imagine infinite versions of the abstract text.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="example-formulation-1-starting-from-the-amount-of-herbs"><em>example formulation 1: starting from the amount of herbs</em></h3>
<p>suppose we're making the <a href="../recipes/hawthorn/scorpius">scorpius</a> tincture. this formula calls for 5 parts hawthorn berries, 2 parts hawthorn leaf, 2 parts linden leaf, and 1 part cinnamon bark. we can start by choosing a amount for the smallest component of the formulation (in this case, cinnamon) and determining the remaining measurements from there; suppose we choose to use 10 g of cinnamon bark. since this is 1 part, the remaining calculations are easy: we would use 2 &times; 10 g = 20 g of linden leaf, 2 &times; 10 g = 20 g of hawthorn leaf, and 5 &times; 10 g = 50 g of hawthorn berries. this yields a total of 10 + 20 + 20 + 50 = 100 g of herb. the mass/weight-to-volume method for this tincture calls for a 1:5 ratio of herbs to 40% alcohol solution. this means we would use 100 &times; 5 = 500 mL of alcohol solution. for 40% concentration, we could use any 80-proof spirit; or to make from 190-proof alcohol, use 500 &times; 0.4 = 200 mL of 190-proof alcohol and 500 &times; 0.6 = 300 mL of spring/filtered/distilled water. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="example-formulation-2-starting-from-the-desired-end-amount"><em>example formulation 2: starting from the desired end amount</em></h3>
<p>suppose we're making the <a href="../recipes/lavender/eraser">eraser</a> salve. this formula calls for making an infused oil using 2 parts lavender, 1 part peppermint, and 1 part chili powder. to convert these parts into measurements, we could start by deciding how much oil to make. standard <a href="./#oils">infused oils</a> are made with a 1:8 ratio of herb to oil; to make it easy, we could choose to use 8 oz of oil, requiring 1 oz of herbs. to calculate the amount of individual herbs, first add all the parts to get the total number of parts, in this case 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. then divide each herb's number of parts by the total to get the proportion for that herb: lavender will be 2 out of 4 parts, or half the total amount of herb; peppermint and chili powder will each be 1 out of 4, or a quarter of the total. using 1 oz total herb, we will use 0.5 oz of lavender, 0.25 oz of peppermint, and 0.25 oz of chili powder to make 8 oz of infused oil. </p>
<p>to turn the oil into a salve, measure the amount of oil remaining after straining and filtering; this will likely be less than 8 oz since some oil will remain absorbed into the powdered herbs. if we have 7.5 oz remaining, then following the section on <a href="./#salves">salves</a> we would add about 7.5 tbsp of beeswax to the oil and stir over a double boiler until it completely melts, then pour into containers.</p>
